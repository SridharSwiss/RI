            <h2>üëã Introduction to the EU AI Act</h2>
            <p>The European Union's AI Act is a landmark piece of legislation, representing the world's first comprehensive attempt to regulate artificial intelligence. Proposed by the European Commission in April 2021 and formally adopted in 2024, the Act aims to ensure that AI systems used in the EU are safe, transparent, ethical, and respect fundamental rights. It follows a risk-based approach, imposing stricter rules on AI systems that pose greater risks to individuals and society.</p>
            <p>This document provides a detailed overview of the EU AI Act, its key provisions, obligations, and implications for businesses and developers working with AI.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Goal:</strong> To establish a harmonized legal framework for AI across the EU, fostering innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights and user safety.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="objectives">
            <h2>üéØ Objectives of the Act</h2>
            <p>The EU AI Act has several overarching objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ensure AI systems are safe and respect fundamental rights and EU values:</strong> Protecting health, safety, and fundamental rights from risks posed by AI systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide legal certainty:</strong> Establishing clear rules to facilitate investment and innovation in AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance governance and effective enforcement:</strong> Creating a robust governance structure for the oversight of AI systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop a single market for lawful, safe, and trustworthy AI applications:</strong> Preventing market fragmentation and ensuring a level playing field.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote an AI that is human-centric and trustworthy:</strong> Ensuring that AI development serves humanity and adheres to ethical principles.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="scope">
            <h2>üåç Scope of the Act</h2>
            <p>The AI Act has a broad territorial scope and applies to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Providers</strong> placing AI systems on the EU market or putting them into service, irrespective of whether they are established within the EU or in a third country.</li>
                <li><strong>Users (deployers)</strong> of AI systems located within the EU.</li>
                <li><strong>Providers and users (deployers)</strong> of AI systems located in a third country, where the output produced by the AI system is used in the EU.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The definition of an AI system in the Act is aligned with the OECD definition, covering machine learning, logic- and knowledge-based approaches, and statistical approaches. It does not apply to AI systems developed or used exclusively for military purposes or to AI systems used by public authorities in a third country or international organisations for law enforcement and judicial cooperation, provided they offer reciprocal safeguards.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="risk-approach">
            <h2>üö¶ Risk-Based Approach</h2>
            <p>The AI Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels, with obligations proportionate to the level of risk:</p>

            <div class="risk-category risk-unacceptable">
                <h3><span class="tooltip">üö´ Unacceptable Risk AI<span class="tooltiptext">AI systems posing a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods, and rights of people.</span></span></h3>
                <p>These AI systems are deemed to present a clear threat to fundamental rights and are therefore <strong>banned</strong> in the EU. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI systems that deploy subliminal techniques beyond a person‚Äôs consciousness to materially distort their behavior in a manner that causes or is likely to cause physical or psychological harm.</li>
                    <li>AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups (due to age, physical or mental disability) to materially distort their behavior in a harmful way.</li>
                    <li>Social scoring systems by public authorities for general purposes.</li>
                    <li>Real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes (with narrow exceptions).</li>
                    <li>Emotion recognition in the workplace and educational institutions (unless for medical/safety reasons).</li>
                    <li>Indiscriminate scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="risk-category risk-high">
                <h3><span class="tooltip">‚ö†Ô∏è High-Risk AI<span class="tooltiptext">AI systems that create a high risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights of persons.</span></span></h3>
                <p>High-risk AI systems are permitted but are subject to stringent requirements and a conformity assessment before being placed on the market. These systems fall into two main categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>AI systems intended to be used as a safety component of products, or are themselves products, covered by existing EU product safety legislation (e.g., toys, medical devices, machinery).</li>
                    <li>Specific AI systems listed in Annex III of the Act, covering critical areas such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biometric identification and categorisation of natural persons (with exceptions for verification).</li>
                            <li>Management and operation of critical infrastructure (e.g., water, gas, electricity).</li>
                            <li>Education and vocational training (e.g., assessing students).</li>
                            <li>Employment, workers management, and access to self-employment (e.g., CV-sorting software).</li>
                            <li>Access to and enjoyment of essential private and public services and benefits (e.g., credit scoring, dispatching emergency services).</li>
                            <li>Law enforcement (e.g., evaluating evidence, predicting crime).</li>
                            <li>Migration, asylum, and border control management (e.g., verifying travel documents, assessing asylum applications).</li>
                            <li>Administration of justice and democratic processes (e.g., AI assisting judicial authorities).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Providers of high-risk AI systems face significant obligations (detailed in the next section).</p>

                <p>For AI systems classified as limited risk, the focus is on transparency. Users should be made aware that they are interacting with an AI system. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons (e.g., chatbots), which must inform users that they are interacting with an AI, unless this is obvious from the context.</li>
                    <li>AI systems used to generate or manipulate image, audio, or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic or truthful ("deepfakes"). The AI-generated nature must be disclosed.</li>
                    <li>AI systems that generate text for publication on matters of public interest must disclose that the text is AI-generated, unless reviewed and edited by a human with editorial responsibility.</li>

        </section>

        <section id="high-risk-obligations">
            <h2>üìù Obligations for Providers of High-Risk AI Systems</h2>
            <p>Providers of high-risk AI systems must comply with a comprehensive set of requirements throughout the AI system's lifecycle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Risk Management System:</strong> Establish, implement, document, and maintain a continuous iterative risk management system.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Governance and Management:</strong> Ensure training, validation, and testing data sets are relevant, representative, free of errors, and complete. Appropriate data governance and management practices must be applied.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Documentation:</strong> Draw up detailed technical documentation demonstrating compliance with the requirements before placing the system on the market. This documentation must be kept up-to-date.</li>
                <li><strong>Record-Keeping (Logging):</strong> Ensure AI systems are designed to automatically record events ("logs") while the high-risk AI systems are operating to ensure a level of traceability of the system's functioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency and Provision of Information to Users:</strong> Design systems to be sufficiently transparent to enable users to interpret the system's output and use it appropriately. Users must be provided with clear and adequate instructions for use.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Ensure systems can be effectively overseen by humans during their use. This includes measures to allow human intervention to prevent or minimize risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity:</strong> Design and develop systems to achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity throughout their lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Conformity Assessment:</strong> Undergo a conformity assessment procedure before being placed on the market or put into service. For most high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III, a self-assessment by the provider is sufficient. However, for certain particularly critical AI systems (e.g., remote biometric identification), a third-party conformity assessment by a Notified Body is required.</li>
                <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Register their high-risk AI systems in an EU-wide public database managed by the European Commission (some exceptions for law enforcement).</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Management System:</strong> Implement a quality management system ensuring compliance with the Act.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Market Monitoring:</strong> Establish and implement a post-market monitoring system to collect and analyze data about the performance of high-risk AI systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Reporting:</strong> Report any serious incidents and malfunctions to national competent authorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Importers and distributors also have specific obligations to ensure that the AI systems they handle comply with the Act.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="transparency">
            <h2>üó£Ô∏è Transparency Requirements for Certain AI Systems</h2>
            <p>Beyond high-risk systems, the Act imposes specific transparency obligations for certain AI systems to ensure individuals are aware they are interacting with AI or exposed to AI-generated content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chatbots and AI interacting with humans:</strong> Users must be informed that they are interacting with an AI system, unless it is obvious.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotion recognition systems and biometric categorisation systems:</strong> Individuals exposed to these systems need to be informed of their operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deepfakes (AI-generated content):</strong> If AI is used to generate or manipulate image, audio, or video content that could be mistaken for authentic, it must be disclosed that the content is AI-generated. This also applies to text generated by AI that is published on matters of public interest.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These rules aim to prevent deception and empower individuals to make informed decisions.</p>

    <h2>üß© Codes of Practice for General Purpose AI (GPAI)</h2>
    <p>
        The EU AI Act introduces specific provisions for <strong>General Purpose AI (GPAI)</strong> models‚ÄîAI systems capable of performing a wide range of tasks and which can be integrated into various downstream applications. These include advanced foundation models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, or similar technologies that underpin many modern AI solutions.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key Objective:</strong> To ensure GPAI models are developed and deployed in a safe, trustworthy, and transparent manner, minimizing risks to fundamental rights, safety, and the broader society, while supporting innovation and the digital single market.
    </div>

    <h3>What are Codes of Practice?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Codes of Practice</strong> are voluntary, non-binding frameworks developed by GPAI providers (often in collaboration with the European Commission, the European AI Office, and relevant stakeholders) that outline concrete measures to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act. They supplement the Act‚Äôs requirements with practical, sector-specific, and evolving guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment.
    </p>

    <h3>Who Must Adhere to Codes of Practice?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Providers of GPAI Models:</strong> All organizations placing GPAI models on the EU market, regardless of their country of origin, must comply with baseline transparency and risk mitigation obligations. For GPAI models assessed as posing <em>systemic risk</em> (e.g., very large models or those with far-reaching impacts), adherence to Codes of Practice becomes even more crucial.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Developers and Deployers:</strong> Organizations fine-tuning, integrating, or otherwise adapting GPAI models for downstream applications are encouraged to follow Codes of Practice, especially if their deployments could influence safety or fundamental rights.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Content of Codes of Practice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Guidance on risk identification, assessment, and mitigation throughout the model‚Äôs lifecycle, including for downstream applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Transparency and Documentation:</strong> Requirements for detailed, public documentation ("model cards") about a GPAI model‚Äôs capabilities, limitations, training data, and intended use cases, as well as any known risks or incidents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Information Sharing:</strong> Mechanisms for providers to share information and best practices with downstream deployers, regulators, and other stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Governance:</strong> Standards for ensuring high-quality, diverse, and representative training data, with steps to minimize bias and discrimination.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cybersecurity and Robustness:</strong> Measures to enhance the security and resilience of GPAI models against misuse, adversarial attacks, or unexpected behaviors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Incident Reporting:</strong> Procedures for timely reporting of significant incidents, malfunctions, or misuse to the European AI Office and national authorities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Recommendations for measuring and minimizing the environmental footprint (e.g., energy use) of training and deploying GPAI models.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Best practices to ensure that GPAI models can be overseen, controlled, or intervened upon by qualified humans, especially in sensitive applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Support for SMEs and Open Source:</strong> Provisions to help smaller enterprises and open-source developers comply with obligations in a proportionate, feasible way.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Development and Oversight</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong>European Commission and the European AI Office</strong> facilitate the creation and regular updating of Codes of Practice in consultation with industry, academia, civil society, and national authorities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Codes of Practice are expected to be <strong>dynamic</strong>, evolving in line with technological progress, emerging risks, and societal expectations.
        </li>
        <li>
            For GPAI models presenting <strong>systemic risk</strong>, the AI Office may require mandatory adherence to Codes of Practice until formal implementing acts or harmonized standards are adopted.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Benefits and Legal Effects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Demonstrating Compliance:</strong> Following Codes of Practice is a strong way for providers to demonstrate their efforts toward legal compliance and responsible AI stewardship under the EU AI Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mitigating Liability:</strong> Adoption can help mitigate potential fines and penalties in the event of regulatory scrutiny or incidents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Market Trust:</strong> Providers adhering to recognized Codes of Practice can foster greater trust with users, partners, and regulators.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Current Status and Next Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first drafts of Codes of Practice are expected to be developed rapidly after the Act enters into force, with the European AI Office playing a central coordinating role.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stakeholders‚Äîincluding GPAI providers, deployers, civil society, and technical experts‚Äîare encouraged to participate in the drafting and revision process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Providers of GPAI models should monitor announcements from the European AI Office and relevant industry consortia for updates, and begin aligning internal policies and technical measures with the anticipated Codes of Practice.
        </li>
